Create a user manually at https://mystore-testlab.coderslab.pl.

Write a script that:

will log in to this created user,
will enter by clicking on the Addresses tile after logging in (the address we should be at is: https://mystore-testlab.coderslab.pl/index.php?controller=addresses ),
will click on + Create new address,
will fill out the New address form - the data should be taken from the Examples table in Gherkin (alias, address, city, zip/postal code, country, phone),
will check if the data in the added address is correct.
will delete the above address by clicking on "delete",
will check if the address has been deleted.
